In this code, the watch_next() function takes in the planet_hulk_description parameter, sets up the Spacy model using en_core_web_md, and initializes the
 max_similarity and next_movie variables.

The function then opens the movies.txt file and iterates over the lines of the file. For each line, it extracts the description and calculates the similarity 
between the description and the planet_hulk_description 
using Spacy's similarity() method. If the similarity score is higher than the previous highest score, it updates the max_similarity and next_movie variables.

After iterating over all the lines in the file, the function returns the value of next_movie, which should be the title of the most similar movie.
